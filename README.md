# Inspiration
Performing mechanical lab practical for student are very complex and difficult to handle such heavy machines and there's a risk to while dealing with it.

# What it does
Mechanical Student Lens will provide a better interaction, ease to perform and interact with Machine very easy & efficiently. Through 3D MACHINE MODELS and HAND TRACKING ever student can perform practical and learn things easily. Students can also ZOOM IN-OUT to view every single part and their details.

# How we built it
By using 3D MACHINE MODELS, HAND TRACKING FEATURE and ZOOM IN-OUT FEATURE we have build our lens.

# Challenges we ran into
The biggest problem we ran into was of hand tracking feature, sometimes it doesn't detect user hand but we solved it too.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building such an interactive, Fully Functioning hand tracking lens was a great accomplishment for us.

# What we learned
We learned about lens studio, java script and about object interaction.

# What's next for Mechanical Student Practical
Making available more complex practical to students for new learnings.
